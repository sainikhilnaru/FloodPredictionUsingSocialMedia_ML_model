# FloodPredictionUsingSocialMedia_ML_model

This is a machine learning model that should predict floods in Harris County and other parts of Houston. Neural networks will be used to build 
a model to predict flood reports in a given area on a map along with several key zones of high risk. Tweets regarding floods will be mined using a twitter api
to use along with this machine learning model.
